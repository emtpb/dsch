Tutorial
========

This tutorial will give you a quick overview on working with DSCH.
Just make sure you have :ref:`installed <installation>` it and get started!


Defining a Schema
-----------------

Let's start with a simple example.
First, we must import :mod:`dsch` itself::

    import dsch

Suppose we want to store data of a little weather station that measures temperature and humidity.
For later processing, we also want to record the date and time of the measurement.
A schema that represents this data could be described like this::

    schema = dsch.schema.Compilation({
        'time': dsch.schema.DateTime(),
        'temperature': dsch.schema.Scalar(dtype='float', unit='Â°C'),
        'humidity': dsch.schema.Scalar(dtype='float', unit='%', min_value=0,
                                    max_value=100)
    })

Here, we use a :class:`~dsch.schema.Compilation` as a container for our data fields.
This allows us to name the individual fields, as well as group them together.
Also, we define the units to be used for the physical quantities and sensible value limits for the humidity.


Opening a Storage
-----------------

DSCH can store data using a number of backends, e.g. different file formats.
However, backends could also be implemented for systems like databases, which mostly do not work with regular files.
Therefore, we use the term "storage" instead of "file" to identify a place where we can save our data to.

To open a storage, we can either use :func:`dsch.load() <dsch.frontend.load>` or :func:`dsch.create() <dsch.frontend.create>`, depending on whether the storage already exists.
In both cases, we must provide a location for the storage, e.g. the path to a file.
Since we started from scratch, we must use :func:`dsch.create() <dsch.frontend.create>`, which requires our previously defined ``schema`` as an argument::

    storage = dsch.create('test.h5', schema)

If we wanted to open an existing storage, we would not need to provide the schema, as it is automatically loaded from the storage::

    storage = dsch.load('test.h5')

Note that in both cases, we did not have to explicitly state the backend to be used.
This is because DSCH automatically detects that this is a file path ending in ".h5" and chooses the HDF5 backend accordingly.
If we wrote ``test.npz``, the NumPy npz backend would be chosen instead.
Of course, autodetection can also be overridden, see :func:`~dsch.frontend.load` and :func:`~dsch.frontend.create`.


Accessing Data
--------------

Once we have a ``storage`` object, we can start accessing the data.
All data is provided as the ``data`` attribute of a storage, which is structured in the exact way that we previously defined in our schema.
So, in our example, ``storage.data`` (the top-level data node) is a Compilation containing three child nodes (``time``, ``temperature`` and ``humidity``).

Child nodes of Compilations are represented as attributes, so they can be easily accessed with the "dotted" notation.
Note, however, that these nodes are not simply the stored values, but objects with additional functionality.
The actual stored value is available through their ``value`` attribute::

    >>> storage.data.time.value
    [...]
    NodeEmptyError: Node is empty. The value of empty nodes is undefined.

Well, we should have expected this!
Since we just created a new, empty file, there is no data present.
In fact, we can check whether a node is empty::

    >>> storage.data.time.empty
    True

This even works for Compilation nodes, where all child nodes are checked recursively::

    >>> storage.data.empty
    True

The ``empty`` attribute is an example of functionality that data nodes provide beyond simply storing a value.
Depending on the node type and the backend in use, there are different functional ranges.

Of course, we can also assign new variables for any node, providing a shortcut for access::

    >>> temp = storage.data.temperature
    >>> temp.empty
    True


Modifying Data
--------------

The data stored in a data node can be changed by setting the ``value`` attribute.
This is also the way to apply an initial value to an empty node::

    import datetime
    storage.data.time.value = datetime.datetime.now()
    storage.data.temperature.value = 21
    storage.data.humidity.value = 42

Now, we can inspect the filled data structure::

    >>> storage.data.empty
    False

    >>> storage.data.temperature.value
    21.0

An alternative to setting all values individually is to use the Compilation's ``replace`` method, which accepts a :class:`dict`::

    storage.data.replace({
        'time': datetime.datetime.now(),
        'temperature': 21,
        'humidity': 42
    })

This is equivalent to the example above.


Data Validation
---------------

All data can be validated against the constraints defined in the schema.
For example, our schema states that the value for ``humidity`` must be in the range from 0 to 100.
Since we previously set that value to 42, validation succeeds (i.e. terminates silently)::

    >>> storage.data.humidity.validate()

However, if we set an out-of range value, a :class:`~dsch.schema.ValidationError` is raised::

    >>> storage.data.humidity.value = 123
    >>> storage.data.humidity.validate()
    [...]
    ValidationError: Maximum value exceeded. (Expected: 100. Got: 123.0)

Of course, we can also validate the entire storage in a single step::

    >>> storage.validate()
    [...]
    SubnodeValidationError: Field "humidity" failed validation: Maximum value exceeded. (Expected: 100. Got: 123.0)

Note that now, a :class:`~dsch.data.SubnodeValidationError` is raised, providing details on the affected node.


Storing Data
------------

For all current backends, changes to the data inside a storage are not automatically written to disk.
To do that, you must call :meth:`~dsch.storage.FileStorage.save` explicitly::

    >>> storage.save()
    [...]
    SubnodeValidationError: Field "humidity" failed validation: Maximum value exceeded.

Oh, right, we still have that invalid value set for ``humidity``!
As we can see, the default is to automatically validate data before saving, preventing us from accidentally producing files with invalid for physically impossible values.
Of course, when we provide a sensible value again, we can easily save our file::

    >>> storage.data.humidity.value = 42
    >>> storage.save()
