Installation
************


Stable release
==============

To install dsch, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install dsch

This is the preferred method to install dsch, as it
will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.
Note that on systems that still use legacy Python as the default, you will have
to use ``pip3`` instead of ``pip``, as dsch only supports Python 3.
